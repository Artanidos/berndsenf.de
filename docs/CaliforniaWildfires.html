      Once again, with a major drought and fire crisis in the USA, I've<br/>
      received several emails asking about the situation, and what might be<br/>
      done to assist Southern California with the Reich cloudbuster, to bring<br/>
      relief to a major crisis.  There are a number of aspects which come
      to<br/>
      mind, none of which offer any immediate relief, but they do highlight<br/>
      the "obstacle in the way", which as Reich noted, is always of
      central<br/>
      importance for any long-term solution to a crisis.  Here is a
      recounting<br/>
      of some of the issues.<br/>
<br/>
      1.  In the early 1990s, when I was living in the San Francisco Bay
      area,<br/>
      a similar wildfire disaster developed in the region of Oakland,<br/>
      California.  Santa Anna winds blossomed and arson-sparked wildfires<br/>
      spread widely, consuming several thousand homes in one single day! 
      The<br/>
      plume of smoke over the region looked like an atomic bomb cloud, and<br/>
      firefighters were unable to put a halt to the fast-moving wildfires, in<br/>
      spite of herculean efforts.  Spurred on by events and calls from<br/>
      friends, a cloudbusting operation was undertaken from the San Francisco<br/>
      bay, just west of Oakland, in efforts to halt or reverse the Santa Anna<br/>
      winds and bring moisture-bearing winds from the ocean.  Given
      logistical<br/>
      difficulties, the cloudbuster could not be set up and put to work until<br/>
      late that evening -- the operators were myself and Ms. Theirrie Cook --<br/>
      the operations lasted through the night into early the next morning,<br/>
      when the fires were expected to flare up and spread widely once again on<br/>
      the second day.  Instead, following the cloudbusting, completely<br/>
      unforecast cool moist ocean breezes flooded into the region, with high<br/>
      humidities and drizzles which ended the Santa Anna winds, and either put<br/>
      the fires out, or caused them to "lay down" sufficiently that<br/>
      firefighters were more readily able to do their job.  That incredible<br/>
      result from a well-engineered cloudbusting operation, using the original<br/>
      designs and principles of Reich, were written up and published in the<br/>
      Journal of Orgonomy ("CORE Progress Report #26: California Drought of<br/>
      1990-1991, Part II. With a Special Note on Underground Nuclear Testing<br/>
      and the Oakland Wildfires", Vol. 26(1):,49-71 1992) and Pulse of the<br/>
      Planet ("The Oakland Wildfires of October 1991", 4:117-118,
      1993).<br/>
      These articles are not posted to internet, but the publications can be<br/>

<br/>
      2.  There are reasons why we no longer try to make contact with<br/>
      officials in California, to inform them about the possibilities with<br/>
      cloudbusting.  Subsequent to the Oakland operations described above,
      and<br/>
      after many other well-engineered cloudbusting operations undertaken by<br/>
      Dr. Richard Blasband and myself and Ms. Cook, several friends of mine<br/>
      were encouraged to make contact with various officials in California,<br/>
      informing them of the good results and trying to interest them in<br/>
      sponsoring cloudbusting operations to help with the on-going drought<br/>
      problems.  Dr. James Prescott used his contacts with the then-Mayor
      of<br/>
      San Diego, attempting to organize an effort to help relieve the<br/>
      water-crisis which was, at that time, forcing the County to impose<br/>
      strong water restrictions.  No interest was obtained, not even a<br/>
      courtesy reply.  Later, another friend, Mr. Donald Bill, approached<br/>
      several officials in Santa Barbara, based upon news reports that the<br/>
      city's water reservoirs were at a very low level, forcing them to spend<br/>
      millions to import water from other regions.  We offered to undertake
      a<br/>
      demonstration project without cost to them, on the provison that if good<br/>
      rains occurred, they would reimburse the expenses -- only a few thousand<br/>
      dollars in that case -- and consider to institute a longer-term project.<br/>
      Mr. Bill and I undertook the work, spending several days in field work,<br/>
      bringing a good unforecast saturating rain over the region which<br/>
      relieved the water crisis and drought.  Once again, the officials<br/>
      basically brushed us off, and worse.  A smear-article attacking me as
      a<br/>
      fraud, quoting some of the same officials, appeared shortly afterwards<br/>
      in the local newspapers. San Diego thereafter recinded the new<br/>
      water-conservation laws they had just passed, and Los Angeles threw out<br/>
      new air-pollution restrictions which had been passed during the drought<br/>
      years.  The overall message was "Hey, it's raining now -- To
      Hell with<br/>
      Nature and the environment!"  (And to us: "Get Lost!")  
      From this and<br/>
      other experiences, we learned the following lesson:  Government<br/>
      officials running bureaucracies devoted to water resources often have a<br/>
      vested interest in NOT seeing water problems be resolved in any quick or<br/>
      effective manner.  When drought exists, they get more money into
      their<br/>
      budgets, they become "important people" who have the ear of the
      Governor<br/>
      and other high-level elected officials, and the news media seeks them<br/>
      out for interviews to make "cute" stories, etc.  When good
      rains occur<br/>
      and no drought exists, their budget is cut, the Governor no longer has<br/>
      time for them, and the news media ignores them.  Crazy world.<br/>
<br/>
      3.  The weather pattern creating the wildfires in southern California<br/>
      seems to be correlated with highly unusual solar flares and sunspots,<br/>
      although the usual pattern is that sunspots and flares will lead to<br/>
      stormy weather, not high-pressure drought.  A huge high-pressure cell<br/>
      exists over the Western States, rotating clock-wise, and this brings<br/>
      moist air into the Seattle region, but pushes hot-dry air from the<br/>
      desert westward towards the ocean in southern California.  The
      problem<br/>
      is therefore much larger than only southern California.  Another<br/>
      wild-card, however, is the continued widespread irresponsible use of<br/>
      various kinds of "cloudbusting" by untrained and
      willfully-ignorant<br/>
      people, notably the "chembuster" fad which has spread most
      widely in the<br/>
      Western states.  As noted on our website, the proponents of this
      madness<br/>
      advocate setting up their devices on a *permanent* basis, around the<br/>
      clock, and this is well-known to cause an *increase in drought*. 
      Since<br/>
      drought has, as one of its major aspects, the spreading of deserts and<br/>
      desert-winds (ie, the Santa Anna winds) it is within the realm of<br/>
      possibility that the current situation is being inflamed by<br/>
      irresponsible "chembusting".  This is not the first time
      this kind of<br/>
      thing has happened -- we have evidence in our files that the Pacific NW<br/>
      drought of the last several years, and the giant heat-wave in Europe<br/>
      last summer, was possibly exacerbated or even caused by the "chembuster"<br/>
      idiots -- and probably it won't be the last time this happens.  My<br/>
      strongest recommendation to the people doing this is: stop it!  Take<br/>
      down your devices immediately!  This alone might collapse the high<br/>
      pressure cell maintaining the Santa Anna winds, quickly ending the<br/>
      wildfires.  More information is posted to:<br/>

<br/>
      4.  It would be possible to end the current wildfires in southern<br/>
      California using techniques previously used to end the Oakland<br/>
      wildfires, as noted above.  However, to do so requires funding beyond<br/>
      our capacities, and considerable logistical organization and support as<br/>
      well.   We are prepared to undertake such a task, but cannot do
      so<br/>
      without considerable expression of interest and support from concerned<br/>
      people, notably from those living in the affected regions. <br/>
